# Tic-Tac-Toe

After using Codecademy to learn elements of C#, decided to have a go at a basic game. 

Aims
- Use a variety of data types - int, bools, string.
- Create and call methods through the project ensuring code is understandable.
- Using an array (button array).
- Using the Random Class - using this to generate an AI for AI turn in the game.
- Using validation statements to check for a winner of the game.
- Using WPF as the user interface for the game.
